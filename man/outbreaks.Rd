\description{
Historical plague mortality data from multiple European and Middle Eastern
cities spanning from 1348 to 1835, compiled by Dean et al.
}
\details{
The dataset includes plague outbreaks from:
\itemize{
\item Barcelona 1490 (daily data, 182 days)
\item Malta 1813 (daily data, 209 days)
\item Florence 1400 (daily data, 180 days)
\item Cairo 1835 (daily data, 366 days)
\item Eyam 1665 (daily data, 145 days)
\item Prague 1713 (daily data, 198 days)
\item London 1563 (weekly data, 225 weeks)
\item Givry 1348 (daily data with some missing values, 138 days)
}

Some datasets contain missing values (NA) where historical records were
incomplete. The London 1563 dataset contains weekly rather than daily
mortality counts (but uses the same 'day' column for consistency).

Users can filter to specific outbreaks using the outbreak_id or location/year:
\code{
# Get Barcelona data
barcelona <- plague_outbreaks |> filter(outbreak_id == "Barcelona_1490")

# Get all 15th century outbreaks
fifteenth_century <- plague_outbreaks |> filter(year >= 1400 & year < 1500)
}
}
\examples{
# View structure of the data
str(outbreaks)

# Summary statistics by outbreak
outbreaks |>
  group_by(outbreak_id, location, year) |>
  summarise(
    duration_days = max(day),
    total_deaths = sum(deaths, na.rm = TRUE),
    peak_deaths = max(deaths, na.rm = TRUE),
    population = first(population)
  )
}

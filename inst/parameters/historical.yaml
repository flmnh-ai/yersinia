# Rat population parameters
K_r: 2000    # Rat carrying capacity (total system, smaller medieval cities)
r_r: 6.0     # Higher growth rate (less urbanization pressure)
p: 0.98      # Higher resistance probability (natural selection)
d_r: 0.15    # Lower baseline death rate (rural/natural conditions)

# Disease transmission parameters
beta_r: 6.0  # Very high transmission (no control measures)
a: 0.003     # Lower search efficiency (different flea species mix)
m_r: 25.0    # Higher mortality rate (virulent historical strains)
g_r: 0.01    # Very low survival probability (no medical care)

# Flea population parameters
r_f: 15.0    # Lower reproduction (cooler Little Ice Age climate)
K_f: 5.0     # Lower carrying capacity (different housing/hygiene)
d_f: 8.0     # Lower death rate (less urban stress)

# Human population parameters
K_h: 3000    # Much smaller population centers
r_h: 0.03    # Lower growth rate (high infant mortality)
d_h: 0.08    # Very high death rate (pre-modern conditions)
beta_h: 0.015 # Higher infection rate (close quarters, poor hygiene)
m_h: 35      # Slower disease progression (different strains?)
g_h: 0.05    # Very low survival probability (no antibiotics)

# Initial conditions
I_ini: 5     # Multiple introduction points common

# Spatial parameters
mu_r: 0.02   # Lower movement (less transportation)
mu_f: 0.005  # Much lower flea movement (walking/animal transport only)

# Environmental parameters
seasonal_amplitude: 0.4  # Strong seasonal effects (Little Ice Age)

# Notes
notes: |
  These parameters attempt to capture conditions during the major
  historical plague pandemics, particularly:

  - The Black Death (1347-1351)
  - The Second Pandemic (14th-19th centuries)
  - Pre-antibiotic medicine
  - Medieval urban conditions
  - Little Ice Age climate

  Key historical factors:
  - No medical interventions
  - Poor sanitation and hygiene
  - Different Yersinia pestis strains
  - Slower transportation networks
  - Smaller, denser urban centers
  - Climate cooling (Little Ice Age)

  These parameters are estimated from:
  - Historical mortality records
  - Archaeological evidence
  - Paleoclimatic data
  - Comparative analysis with modern outbreaks

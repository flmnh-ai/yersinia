# Rat population parameters
r_r: 4.5     # Slightly lower growth rate (urbanization effects)
p: 0.96      # Slightly lower resistance probability
d_r: 0.25    # Higher death rate (urban stressors)

# Disease transmission parameters
beta_r: 5.0  # Higher transmission rate (denser populations)
a: 0.005     # Improved flea search efficiency estimate
m_r: 18.0    # Faster disease progression (modern strains)
g_r: 0.03    # Slightly higher survival probability (heterogeneity)

# Flea population parameters
r_f: 22.0    # Higher reproduction rate (warmer urban environments)
K_f: 7.0     # Higher carrying capacity (urban food sources)
d_f: 12.0    # Higher death rate (urban challenges)

# Human population parameters
r_h: 0.05    # Higher growth rate (demographic transition)
d_h: 0.035   # Lower mortality (modern medicine)
beta_h: 0.012 # Slightly higher infection rate (closer contact)
m_h: 24      # Faster recovery (medical care)
g_h: 0.15    # Much higher survival probability (antibiotics)

# Spatial parameters
mu_r: 0.05   # Higher movement rates (transportation networks)
mu_f: 0.012  # Higher flea movement (human transport)

# Seasonal parameters
seasonal_amplitude: 0.25  # Moderate seasonality (climate change effects)


# Notes
notes: |
  These parameters reflect updates based on:
  - Urban ecology studies of rat populations
  - Modern flea biology research
  - Contemporary plague outbreak data
  - Climate change effects on vector ecology
  - Improved medical outcomes for human cases

  Key differences from historical parameters:
  - Higher population densities (urban growth)
  - Faster movement rates (transportation)
  - Better human survival (antibiotics)
  - Stronger seasonal effects (climate variability)
